# Complete Guide: Integrating Custom Hummingbot with Somnia Connector to Dashboard

## 🎯 **The Problem**

- You have a **custom Hummingbot build** with **Somnia connector**
- Dashboard uses **standard Hummingbot Docker images** (no Somnia connector)
- Need to make Dashboard recognize and work with your custom Somnia connector

---

## 🔧 **Option 1: Volume Mount Approach (Quick & Easy)**

### **What it does:**

Mounts your custom Hummingbot source code into the standard Docker container

### **Pros:**

- ✅ Quick to implement (5 minutes)
- ✅ No Docker building required
- ✅ Easy to test and iterate
- ✅ Changes reflect immediately

### **Cons:**

- ❌ Potential file permission issues
- ❌ Dependencies might be missing in container
- ❌ Less reliable for production

### **Implementation:**

```bash
# Stop current services
cd /home/thien/deploy
docker-compose down

# Create custom docker-compose with volume mounts
# (I'll show you the exact file)

# Restart with custom config
docker-compose up -d
```

## 🏗️ **Option 2: Build Custom API Image (Best for Production)**

### **What it does:**

Creates a custom Docker image with your Somnia connector baked in

### **Pros:**

- ✅ Most reliable and stable
- ✅ All dependencies properly installed
- ✅ Production-ready
- ✅ Can be versioned and distributed

### **Cons:**

- ❌ Takes longer to build (10-15 minutes)
- ❌ Need to rebuild for code changes
- ❌ Requires Docker build knowledge

### **Implementation:**

```bash
# 1. Create Dockerfile.api (already done)
# 2. Update docker-compose to build locally
# 3. Build and run custom image
```

---

## 🔀 **Option 3: Hybrid Local Development (Development-friendly)**

### **What it does:**

Run Dashboard in Docker but connect to your local Hummingbot instance

### **Pros:**

- ✅ Use your exact local setup
- ✅ No Docker complications
- ✅ Perfect for development
- ✅ Easy debugging

### **Cons:**

- ❌ More complex networking setup
- ❌ Need to run Hummingbot API locally
- ❌ Less portable

### **Implementation:**

```bash
# 1. Run Hummingbot API locally on your machine
# 2. Configure Dashboard to connect to localhost API
# 3. Only run Dashboard UI in Docker
```

---

## 🚀 **Option 4: Full Local Setup (Complete Control)**

### **What it does:**

Run everything locally without Docker

### **Pros:**

- ✅ Complete control
- ✅ Easy debugging
- ✅ No Docker complexity
- ✅ Fast iteration

### **Cons:**

- ❌ Manual dependency management
- ❌ More setup steps
- ❌ Environment conflicts possible

### **Implementation:**

```bash
# 1. Clone Dashboard source code
# 2. Install Dashboard dependencies locally
# 3. Configure to use your local Hummingbot
# 4. Run everything with Python/Node
```

---

## 🔌 **Option 5: Connector Plugin Approach (Advanced)**

### **What it does:**

Package Somnia connector as a plugin that Dashboard can dynamically load

### **Pros:**

- ✅ Clean separation
- ✅ Reusable across setups
- ✅ Professional approach
- ✅ Easy distribution

### **Cons:**

- ❌ Most complex to implement
- ❌ Requires Dashboard modification
- ❌ Need plugin system understanding
