## Details

### Launch Status
**NOT LAUNCHED YET** - As of July 2025, Standard Testnet mainnet has not been launched.

### Development Timeline (from testnet.standard-testnet.network roadmap)
- ✅ Betanet: World Builder, Dynamic Worlds, New UI/UX rollout, Standard Testnet SDK
- ✅ Road to Devnet: Updated litepaper
- ✅ Devnet Launch: Devnet public tests, Transfers, Native dex tests, NFT mint and trading
- ✅ Testnet: Testnet launch, Validator, Betanet Migration, Devnet public tests
- ⏳ **Mainnet**: Mainnet launch (PENDING)

### Expected Chain Characteristics (based on testnet)
- **Performance**: 1,000,000+ TPS with sub-second finality
- **Fees**: Sub-cent transaction fees
- **Compatibility**: EVM-compatible Layer 1 blockchain
- **Consensus**: Proof-of-stake with MultiStream consensus protocol

### Chain Name
Standard Testnet Mainnet (expected)

[To be announced upon mainnet launch]

### Native Token
[To be announced - likely SOM or native STT]

### Block Explorer
[To be announced upon mainnet launch]

### RPC Endpoint
[To be announced - likely via Ankr partnership like testnet]

### Exchange Contract Address
[To be announced upon mainnet launch]

### REST API Endpoints
[To be announced - likely similar structure to testnet]

### WebSocket Endpoints

### Trading Pairs
[To be announced - likely native token pairs and major tokens]

### Rate Limits
[To be announced - likely more restrictive than testnet]

### Fee Structure

## Research Notes

- Mainnet launch is planned but no specific date announced as of July 2025
- Current focus is on testnet (Shannon) development and ecosystem building
- Ankr partnership for RPC services suggests similar infrastructure for mainnet
- EVM compatibility means standard Ethereum tooling should work
- High performance claims (1M+ TPS) suggest different scaling approach than typical L1s

## Next Steps for Mainnet Preparation

1. Monitor official announcements for mainnet launch date
2. Join Discord for developer updates: https://discord.com/invite/standard-testnet
3. Test connector thoroughly on testnet first
4. Prepare configuration switching mechanism for mainnet transition
5. Update constants and contract addresses when mainnet details are announced
