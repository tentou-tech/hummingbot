# Exchange-Level Auto-Batching Implementation Plan

## User Requirements
- Revert non-working implementation code (AMM strategy modifications)
- Modify `_place_order` function in `standard_exchange.py` to create a queue-based system
- Execute batch orders when:
  - Batch has enough orders (configurable constant)
  - Over a pre-defined time period (configurable constant)
- Keep using `USING_BATCH_ORDER` environment variable to enable/disable

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Revert Non-Working Code ✅
- [x] Revert AMM arbitrage strategy batch order modifications
- [x] Revert PMM strategy mixin approach
- [x] Clean up standard_exchange.py from complex auto-batching code
- [x] Keep only working base infrastructure

### Phase 2: Implement Exchange-Level Queue System ✅
- [x] Add batch queue infrastructure to StandardExchange
- [x] Add configurable constants for batch size and timeout
- [x] Modify `_place_order` to use queue system when enabled
- [x] Implement batch execution logic

### Phase 3: Configuration & Constants ✅
- [x] Add batch configuration constants to standard_constants.py
- [x] Ensure USING_BATCH_ORDER controls the feature
- [x] Add proper logging and monitoring

### Phase 4: Testing & Validation ✅
- [x] Test configuration system functionality
- [x] Verify batch execution methods exist and are accessible
- [x] Confirm environment variable toggle works
- [x] Implementation ready for PMM strategy testing

## Implementation Status: COMPLETE ✅

The exchange-level batch order system has been successfully implemented with:

1. **Queue-Based Architecture**: Orders are queued and executed in batches
2. **Configurable Thresholds**:
   - Batch size threshold: 5 orders (configurable via `BATCH_SIZE_THRESHOLD`)
   - Timeout threshold: 1.0 seconds (configurable via `BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`)
3. **Environment Toggle**: Controlled via `USING_BATCH_ORDER=true/false` in .env file
4. **Fallback Support**: Graceful fallback to individual orders if batch execution fails
5. **Thread Safety**: Proper async locking for concurrent order handling

## Next Steps for Testing:
1. Run PMM strategy with `USING_BATCH_ORDER=true`
2. Verify that orders are properly queued and batched
3. Monitor logs for batch execution confirmation
4. Test fallback behavior by temporarily disabling standardweb3

## Technical Architecture

```
Individual Orders → Queue System → Batch Execution
                     ↓
              [Timer] [Size Limit]
                     ↓
              batch_order_create()
```

## Configuration Constants
- `BATCH_SIZE_THRESHOLD`: Number of orders to trigger batch (default: 5)
- `BATCH_TIMEOUT_SECONDS`: Time limit to wait for more orders (default: 1.0)
- Environment: `USING_BATCH_ORDER=true/false`

## Files to Modify
1. `/root/hummingbot/hummingbot/connector/exchange/standard/standard_constants.py`
2. `/root/hummingbot/hummingbot/connector/exchange/standard/standard_exchange.py`
3. `/root/hummingbot/hummingbot/strategy/amm_arb/amm_arb.py` (revert)
4. `/root/hummingbot/hummingbot/strategy/pure_market_making/start.py` (revert)

Status: Ready to begin implementation
